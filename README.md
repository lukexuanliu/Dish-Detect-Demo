# DishDetect

DishDetect is an AI-powered food identification application that helps users instantly recognize dishes at restaurants. Simply snap a photo of any food, and DishDetect will identify the dish, provide detailed information about ingredients, nutrition facts, and price estimates.

## üçΩÔ∏è About the Project

This project is a **demonstration prototype** built via zero-shot prompt in Bolt. It showcases the UI/UX flow and core functionality using mock data. In a production environment, this app would connect to real AI services for image analysis and restaurant databases.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dish Identification**: Capture photos of restaurant dishes for instant recognition
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Use camera, gallery photos, or image URLs
- **Location Detection**: Automatically detect restaurant location
- **Detailed Analysis**: View comprehensive dish details including:
  - Dish name and description
  - Price estimate
  - Ingredients list
  - Nutrition facts
  - Similar dishes recommendations
- **History Tracking**: Keep a record of all identified dishes
- **Settings Management**: Customize app preferences
- **Feedback System**: Rate the accuracy of dish identification

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with tab-based navigation
- **UI Components**: Custom-built components with Themed support
- **Styling**: React Native StyleSheet with responsive design
- **Icons**: Lucide React Native for consistent iconography
- **Camera Integration**: Expo Camera for photo capture
- **Location Services**: Expo Location for restaurant detection
- **Image Handling**: Expo Image Picker for gallery selection
- **Animations**: React Native Reanimated for smooth interactions
- **State Management**: React useState and useEffect hooks
- **Typography**: Google Fonts (Poppins, Outfit) via Expo Google Fonts

## üì∑ Camera & Image Processing

The app demonstrates how to implement:
- Camera integration with permission handling
- Gallery image selection
- Image URL support
- Location detection for restaurant identification

## üß† AI Integration (Mocked)

In a production version, the app would use:
- Together.ai or similar AI services for image recognition
- Restaurant database APIs for menu and pricing information
- User data collection to improve recognition accuracy

## üì± Responsive Design

The interface is designed to work seamlessly across:
- Various screen sizes
- Both iOS and Android platforms
- Web preview (with platform-specific adaptations)

## üöÄ Next Steps for Production

To turn this demo into a production app:
1. Integrate with real AI image recognition services
2. Connect to restaurant and menu databases
3. Implement user authentication
4. Add cloud storage for history and preferences
5. Develop offline capabilities
6. Improve accuracy with machine learning

## üìù Note

This application is a demonstration prototype built with mock data. The UI flows and interactions are fully functional, but the dish identification uses predetermined responses rather than actual AI analysis.
